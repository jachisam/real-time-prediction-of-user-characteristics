# real-time-prediction-of-user-characteristics

Final Project Idea  
6. What can we learn about the user from interactions? Existing work has sought to uncover attributes such as biases, personality traits, and next click prediction by applying machine learning methods. What else can we uncover? How might we extend or improve existing literature?  

Title:   
Real-Time Prediction of User Characteristics   

Team Members:

Pitch:  
Different personality types have different preferences when it comes to interacting with data. How then does one determine a person’s personality type besides assessment quizzes? There seems to be a correlation between the personality trait locus of control and search strategy (Breadth-First search or Depth-First search). Therefore, given search strategy one can infer locus of control and the knowledge of this characteristic can be used to modify the visualization to be more appealing to the client. Our study intends to devise a way to interpret user’s web interactions and classify them as either depth-first search or breadth-first search. Given a dataset that records user interaction data (e.g., clicks and hovers), we want to predict the users’ characteristics (e.g., locus of control). Also, we would like to make this prediction happen in real-time, with periodic, gradual refinements of accuracy. Essentially, we attempt to solve three problems:  
How to encode the interactions such that we can readily input the interactions into some established algorithms?  
How to actually classify and predict user characteristics?  
How to do all of these quickly and accurately?  

Definition of success:   
We are able to propose a system that records and encodes user interactions, and offers predictions on user characteristics with decent accuracy and speed.
